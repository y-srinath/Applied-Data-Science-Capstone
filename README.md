This capstone project focuses on predicting whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX lists Falcon 9 launches at $62 million, while other providers charge over $165 million—a significant difference driven by SpaceX’s ability to reuse the first stage.

Accurately predicting first-stage landing outcomes helps estimate launch costs and provides valuable insight for organizations looking to compete with SpaceX in commercial launch bids.

This repository includes an overview of the challenge, the datasets used, and the analytical tools applied throughout the project.
